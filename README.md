# Course & Tutorial Resource Pack

It can be tricky to find assets and resources for your tutorial or course that have the correct license. We’ve spent some time creating a pack of resources that you can download and use however you’d like in your content, with very few limitations. Here’s what the pack includes, and we’re adding to it all the time:

- Photography
- Product Mockups
- Patterns
- Icons
- Slide Templates

## Including the License File

All you need to remember is that you must include the appropriate license file, if you’re using any of these in a source file download with your tutorial or course. That’s it!
